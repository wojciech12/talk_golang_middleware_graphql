# Middleware at Spacelift

In this series of talks, I want to share how we use middleware in our GraphQL API. A well-written middleware helps maintain a fast pace of development, even as both the application and the engineering team grow significantly. I hope my talk will help you in desiging your own.

In the first talk, we cover the heart of our middleware â€“ [github.com/spacelift-io/spcontext](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spcontext).
